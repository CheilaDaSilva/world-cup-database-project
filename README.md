# world-cup-database-project
Project for the FreeCodeCamp Relational Databases (Beta) Certification


Project goal: 
- Create a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.

Steps taken:
- Created a database called worldcup and appropriate tables (called "teams" and "games") to visualise the data from games.csv, taking in account any primary keys and foreign keys required to relate the tables.
- Created a Bash script that reads the csv data and uses SQL query commands to insert the data automatically into the tables previously created.
- Utilized SQL to query the database and obtain useful values.
